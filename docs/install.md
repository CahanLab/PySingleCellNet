PySingleCellnet depends on several packages, most of which can be installed with pip, and some are available in conda channels.

I recommend pre-installing the following:

```shell
pip install scanpy python-igraph leidenalg
```

Then, you should be able to install pySingleCellNet with PIP as follows:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/CahanLab/pySingleCellNet.git
```

This will install any remaining required packages, too
