abstract = {In recent years, genome-wide profiling approaches have begun to uncover the molecular programs that drive developmental processes. In particular, technical advances that enable genome-wide profiling of thousands of individual cells have provided the tantalizing prospect of cataloging cell type diversity and developmental dynamics in a quantitative and comprehensive manner. Here, we review how single-cell {RNA} sequencing has provided key insights into mammalian developmental and stem cell biology, emphasizing the analytical approaches that are specific to studying gene expression in single cells. \copyright 2017.

abstract = {{SCANPY} is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data. It includes methods for preprocessing, visualization, clustering, pseudotime and trajectory inference, differential expression testing, and simulation of gene regulatory networks. Its Python-based implementation efficiently deals with data sets of more than one million cells ( https://github.com/theislab/Scanpy ). Along with {SCANPY}, we present {ANNDATA}, a generic class for handling annotated data matrices ( https://github.com/theislab/anndata ).}

abstract = {Here we present a compendium of single-cell transcriptomic data from the model organism Mus musculus that comprises more than 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues. These data represent a new resource for cell biology, reveal gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations and enable the direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types that are shared between tissues, such as T lymphocytes and endothelial cells from different anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used for most organs: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3'-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, whereas the other, full-length transcript analysis based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting, enabled the characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The cumulative data provide the foundation for an atlas of transcriptomic cell biology.}

abstract = {Single-cell {RNA}-seq has emerged as a powerful tool in diverse applications, from determining the cell-type composition of tissues to uncovering regulators of developmental programs. A near-universal step in the analysis of single-cell {RNA}-seq data is to hypothesize the identity of each cell. Often, this is achieved by searching for combinations of genes that have previously been implicated as being cell-type specific, an approach that is not quantitative and does not explicitly take advantage of other single-cell {RNA}-seq studies. Here, we describe our tool, {SingleCellNet}, which addresses these issues and enables the classification of query single-cell {RNA}-seq data in comparison to reference single-cell {RNA}-seq data. {SingleCellNet} compares favorably to other methods in sensitivity and specificity, and it is able to classify across platforms and species. We highlight {SingleCellNet}'s utility by classifying previously undetermined cells, and by assessing the outcome of a cell fate engineering experiment. Copyright \copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Ageing is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death1. Despite rapid advances over recent years, many of the molecular and cellular processes that underlie the progressive loss of healthy physiology are poorly understood2. To gain a better insight into these processes, here we generate a single-cell transcriptomic atlas across the lifespan of Mus musculus that includes data from 23 tissues and organs. We found cell-specific changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age-related changes in the cellular composition of different organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data, we assessed cell-type-specific manifestations of different hallmarks of ageing-such as senescence3, genomic instability4 and changes in the immune system2. This transcriptomic atlas-which we denote Tabula Muris Senis, or 'Mouse Ageing Cell Atlas'-provides molecular information about how the most important hallmarks of ageing are reflected in a broad range of tissues and cell types.}

abstract = {Stem cell engineering is a powerful platform to address numerous challenges in regenerative medicine and developmental biology. Typically, engineered populations are derived by exposing pluripotent stem cells to a series of signaling cues meant to recapitulate developmental milestones, such as the induction of the primitive streak. Morphologic, genetic, transcriptomic, and functional differences between fully differentiated in vivo and engineered populations have long been recognized. However, the correspondence between engineered and native embryonic progenitors has been relatively less well characterized, largely due to their transient and highly heterogenous nature, and therefore many studies have relied on expression of a few canonical markers to ensure that their cells are on the correct path. To address this challenge, we first generated an in vivo gastrulation mouse single cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) reference data set and used it to train a collection of computational tools for comparing cell types, states, regulators, and trajectories across studies. Then we used these tools to evaluate a commonly used protocol designed to promote mesoderm derivation, as well as four previously published biomimetic protocols. Finally, we diversified our toolkits to reach a broader scientific community by implementing our primary analysis tool in Python and as an interactive web application.}

We created a human reference atlas comprising nearly 500,000 cells from 24 different tissues and organs, many from the same donor. This atlas enabled molecular characterization of more than 400 cell types, their distribution across tissues, and tissue-specific variation in gene expression. Using multiple tissues from a single donor enabled identification of the clonal distribution of T cells between tissues, identification of the tissue-specific mutation rate in B cells, and analysis of the cell cycle state and proliferative potential of shared cell types across tissues. Cell type-specific {RNA} splicing was discovered and analyzed across tissues within an individual.}
