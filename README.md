# PySingleCellNet: a computational toolkit for the single cell analysis and comparison of embryos and embryo models
PySingleCellNet (PySCN) predicts the 'cell type' of query scRNA-seq data by Random forest multi-class classification. See [Tan & Cahan 2019] for more details. PySCN includes functionality to aid in the analysis of engineered cell populations (i.e. cells derived via directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells or via direct conversion).
