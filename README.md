# Embryopy: a computational platform to decode embryonic resemblance
Embryopy predicts the 'cell type' of query scRNA-seq data by Random forest multi-class classification. See [Tan & Cahan 2019] for more details. Embryopy includes functionality to aid in the analysis of engineered cell populations (i.e. cells derived via directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells or via direct conversion). It also examine the different categories of in vitro cells as compared to in vivo cells via categorization and GSEA analysis.
